Modest Maps JS is a BSD-licensed display and interaction library for tile-based 
maps in Javascript.

Our intent is to provide a minimal, extensible, customizable, and free display 
library for discriminating designers and developers who want to use interactive 
maps in their own projects. Modest Maps provides a core set of features in a 
tight, clean package, with plenty of hooks for additional functionality. 

Though Modest Maps JS is in its infancy it's derived from our trusty Python and 
Actionscript code that has served us well for years. The best place to see it 
in action today is Walking Papers, at http://walkingpapers.org
